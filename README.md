# ZK-Proof Membership Verifier

This repository provides a minimalist framework for **Private Membership Verification** using Zero-Knowledge Snarks (zk-SNARKs). It allows a user to prove they are part of a Merkle Tree of "Authorized Members" without disclosing which specific leaf belongs to them.

### Technical Stack
* **Circuit Logic:** Written in `Circom` to define the constraints of the membership proof.
* **On-Chain Verifier:** A Solidity contract generated by `SnarkJS` that validates proofs.
* **Merkle Trees:** Used to manage the set of authorized member hashes.

### The Flow
1. **Setup:** Generate the `Pot12` and `zkey` files for the circuit.
2. **Prove:** A member generates a proof off-chain using their secret key and the Merkle path.
3. **Verify:** The member submits the proof to the `Verifier.sol` contract. If valid, the contract confirms membership without knowing the user's address.



### Privacy Features
* **Anonymity:** No linkable data is stored on-chain during the verification process.
* **Security:** Proofs are computationally infeasible to forge without the secret witness.
